# **6. Addition of Alert to Our Component**

## **Overview**

In this short lecture, the instructor enhances the Livewire file upload component by adding an **alert message** (flash-style notification) that appears after:

1. The image is uploaded
2. The job is dispatched
3. The email has been “sent” (synchronously for now)

This prepares the UI for more advanced, asynchronous background jobs that will be introduced in the next sections.

---

# **1. Why the Alert Appears Immediately**

Currently:

* The queue connection is still set to `sync`
* Meaning: jobs are executed **instantly**, within the same request

Because everything is happening locally:

* No TCP/IP latency
* No external mail server
* No remote queue worker
* No long-running processing

=> The alert shows up **immediately**, giving the illusion that the system is instant.

(Added clarification: Once Redis/database queues and image processing jobs are introduced, the delay will be visible.)

---

# **2. The Added Livewire Component**

The instructor added a new Livewire component that displays a flash message after the job finishes.

This component works with:

* **Livewire** for reactive updates
* **Alpine.js** for dynamic UI behavior (show/hide transitions)

### Example structure:

```blade
<div x-data="{ show: true }" x-show="show" class="alert alert-success">
    Your image has been processed and the email has been sent!
</div>
```

(Added clarification: Alpine is used because Breeze + Livewire includes Alpine.js by default, making transitions easy without writing custom JavaScript.)

---

# **3. Integration in the Upload Component**

Inside the main upload component:

* After the job dispatch is done
* And the form request completes
* The flash/alert component is triggered

Depending on the implementation, this could be:

* A Livewire emit event
* A Session flash
* A public Livewire property update

The instructor already showed the alert appearing in the UI, thus confirming integration works.

---

# **4. Why This Matters Before Using Asynchronous Queues**

Right now everything is instant because:

* The emails are sent locally
* There is no real queue worker
* There is no remote infrastructure

Once we switch to **Redis** or **database** queue drivers:

* Delays will become noticeable
* Image processing tasks will take time (resizing 3 images)
* Email sending might take seconds depending on the service
* The UI alert will be useful for user feedback

The alert component prepares the UI for more realistic queue behavior.

---

# **5. Preview of What Comes Next**

The instructor explains the next major step:

> The simple ImageProcessor job will be split into **multiple jobs**, each responsible for creating a different image size.

For example:

* Job 1 → Create thumbnail (50x50)
* Job 2 → Create medium size (500x500)
* Job 3 → Create large image (1200x1200)

Then:

* A **final job** is queued to send the email with the processed images attached.

This is a classic queue dependency workflow, and the alert UI component will help demonstrate:

* When processing starts
* When processing ends
* How long the queue took
* How job chaining behaves
* Differences between synchronous vs asynchronous queue drivers

---

# **6. Summary**

### ✔ Added a Livewire + Alpine.js alert component

### ✔ Alert shows instantly because jobs run synchronously locally

### ✔ Component is positioned in preparation for async queue behavior

### ✔ Next lessons introduce:

* Multiple background jobs
* Queue dependencies
* Job chaining
* Image processing
* Email sending after all jobs complete

This alert will visually show results as job execution becomes more complex.
